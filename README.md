# NCC Hub and Spoke Collaborative Configuration

This repository provides a Terraform configuration for deploying a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Network Connectivity Center (NCC) hub-and-spoke architecture, with separate hub and spoke projects for improved team collaboration. It builds on the proof-of-concept from [bleeng089/Armageddon_6.5_6-2025](https://github.com/bleeng089/Armageddon_6.5_6-2025), introducing a three-phase deployment process and GCS-based state management.

## Structure
- `hub/`: Contains the Terraform configuration for the NCC hub, including VPC, subnet, HA VPN Gateway, Cloud Router, and NCC hub resources. See `hub/README.md` for details.
- `spoke/`: Contains the Terraform configuration for a single spoke, including VPC, subnet, HA VPN Gateway, and Cloud Router. See `spoke/README.md` for details.
- `spoke2/`: Contains the configuration for a second spoke (similar to spoke/).

## Features
- Separate hub and spoke configurations for independent management.
- Three-phase deployment: 
  - Phase 1: Core infrastructure (VPC, subnets, VPN gateways, routers)
  - Phase 2: VPN connectivity (tunnels, BGP peering, NCC spokes)
  - Phase 3: Spoke-to-spoke communication (firewall rules)
- GCS buckets for state management and shared secrets.
- Support for multiple spokes via the hub's `spoke_configs` variable.
- Dynamic firewall rules for spoke-to-spoke communication.

# *New Task 3* Implementation 

### *Extended Underlay Architecture*
- **Public Subnet Extension**: Creates a new public-facing subnet in a different region (`northamerica-northeast1`) from the existing private infrastructure
- **Windows Jumpbox**: Deploys a Windows Server VM with public RDP access for administrative purposes
- **Private Infrastructure Utilization**: Leverages existing private subnet (`10.191.1.0/24`) for Linux workloads

### *Member-Specific Linux Environments*
- **Individualized VMs**: Creates Linux VMs with firewall tags named after each group member
- **Customized Web Experience**: Each VM features:
  - *Roboto Mono* font implementation
  - Resource information positioned in top-left corner
  - Personalized success statement: *"I, [Member Name], will make $[Salary] per year thanks to Theo and [Influencer]!"*
  - Custom background and promotional images
  - Centered promotional material from favorite media

### *Load Balancing & High Availability*
- **Internal Load Balancer**: Deployed in existing private subnet with dedicated IP
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Linux VMs distributed across multiple availability zones
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and instance replacement

### *Secure Access Control*
- **Tag-Based Firewalling**: Uses GCP firewall tags instead of IP ranges for access control
- **Windows → Linux Access**: Only Windows VM can access Linux VMs via specific tags
- **Public RDP Access**: Windows VM accessible via RDP from anywhere

### *Cross-Spoke Connectivity*
- **Hub-and-Spoke Integration**: Leverages existing NCC architecture for communication
- **DNS Resolution**: Optional Cloud DNS setup for internal name resolution
- **Future Expansion**: Designed to support multiple spokes with cross-communication

## *Usage Workflow*
1. **RDP Connection**: Connect to Windows VM using provided public IP
2. **Browser Access**: Paste internal load balancer IP into browser
3. **Load Balancing**: Automatically cycles between member Linux VMs
4. **Custom Experience**: Each refresh shows different member's customized page

## *Terraform Integration*
- **Conditional Deployment**: Controlled by `deploy_task_3` boolean variable
- **Modular Design**: Reusable across all spokes
- **Output Visibility**: Clear outputs for easy access to IPs and connection strings

*Task 3 successfully extends the existing NCC hub-and-spoke architecture while meeting all specified constraints for member-specific deployments, access control, and cross-communication capabilities.*

## Getting Started
1. Configure the hub project in `hub/terraform.tfvars` and deploy Phase 1 (`deploy_phase2 = false`, `deploy_phase3 = false`).
2. Configure each spoke project in `spoke/terraform.tfvars` and `spoke2/terraform.tfvars` using hub outputs and deploy Phase 1.
3. Enable Phase 2 (`deploy_phase2 = true`) for both hub and spokes to establish VPN connectivity.
4. Enable Phase 3 (`deploy_phase3 = true`) on the hub to generate the `all_spoke_cidrs` output.
5. Verify the hub outputs contain all spoke CIDRs: `terraform output all_spoke_cidrs` should show `["10.191.1.0/24", "10.191.2.0/24"]`
6. Enable Phase 3 (`deploy_phase3 = true`) on both spokes to enable spoke-to-spoke communication.
7. Refer to `hub/README.md` and `spoke/README.md` for detailed instructions.

## Overview

The hub-and-spoke model centralizes network management in the hub, which facilitates connectivity to one or more spoke projects. The hub includes a VPC, subnet, HA VPN Gateway, Cloud Router, and Network Connectivity Center (NCC) hub. Each spoke has its own VPC, subnet, HA VPN Gateway, and Cloud Router, connected to the hub via VPN tunnels and NCC spokes. A shared Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket stores secrets for secure communication.

- **Required Roles in Hub Project**:
  - `roles/compute.networkAdmin` - For VPC, subnet, VPN gateway, and firewall management
  - `roles/networkconnectivity.hubAdmin` - For NCC hub administration
  - `roles/storage.admin` - For GCS bucket creation and management

**Spoke Service Accounts Access in Hub Project**:
Each spoke service account (from `var.spoke_configs`) requires:
- `roles/compute.networkUser` - For network resource access
- `roles/networkconnectivity.spokeAdmin` - For NCC spoke administration
- `roles/storage.objectViewer` - For reading shared secrets from GCS
- `roles/storage.objectAdmin` - For accessing hub state files

- `roles/storage.objectViewer` - For reading spoke state files

## GCS Bucket Requirements

### State Management Buckets

1. **Hub State Bucket** (`walid-hub-backend`):
   - Stores hub Terraform state with prefix `hub-state`
   - Requires read/write access for hub service account
   - Requires read access for spoke service accounts

2. **Spoke State Buckets** (`walid-spoke-a-backend`, `walid-spoke-b-backend`):
   - Stores spoke Terraform state with prefixes `spoke-a-state`, `spoke-b-state`
   - Requires read/write access for spoke service accounts
   - Requires read access for hub service account

### Shared Secrets Bucket

3. **Shared Secrets Bucket** (`walid-secrets-backend`):
   - Stores VPN shared secrets and configuration data
   - Requires write access for hub service account
   - Requires read access for spoke service accounts

## Service Account Key Requirements

### Terraform Provider Credentials

**Hub Deployment**:
```hcl
provider "google" {
  project     = var.ncc_project_id
  region      = var.ncc_region
  credentials = file(var.ncc_credentials_path)  # Hub service account key
  alias       = "ncc_hub"
}
```

**Spoke Deployment**:
```hcl
provider "google" {
  project     = var.spoke_project_id
  region      = var.spoke_region
  credentials = file(var.spoke_credentials_path)  # Spoke service account key
}
```

### Required Service Account Keys

1. **Hub Service Account Key**:
   - Path: `var.ncc_credentials_path` (e.g., `../../../G-secrets/ncc-project-467401-3af773551e59.json`)
   - Used by: Hub Terraform provider
   - Permissions: Full access to hub project resources

2. **Spoke Service Account Keys**:
   - Path: `var.spoke_credentials_path` (e.g., `../../../G-secrets/pelagic-core-467122-q4-25d0b2aa49f2.json`)
   - Used by: Spoke Terraform providers
   - Permissions: Full access to spoke project resources
  
## Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. **Create Service Accounts**:
   - Create hub service account in hub project with required roles
   - Create spoke service accounts in spoke projects with required roles
   - Generate and download JSON keys for all service accounts

2. **Configure GCS Buckets**:
   - Create state buckets for hub and spoke projects
   - Create shared secrets bucket
   - Configure appropriate IAM permissions

3. **Deploy Hub (Phase 1)**:
   ```bash
   cd hub
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   ```

4. **Deploy Spokes (Phase 1)**:
   ```bash
   cd spoke
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   ```

### Phase 2: VPN Connectivity

1. **Enable Phase 2 Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Hub
   cd hub
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   # Spokes
   cd spoke
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   ```

### Phase 3: Spoke-to-Spoke Communication

1. **Enable Phase 3 on Hub** (generates all_spoke_cidrs output):
   ```bash
   cd hub
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=true"
   
   # Verify the output contains all spoke CIDRs
   terraform output all_spoke_cidrs
   # Should show: ["10.191.1.0/24", "10.191.2.0/24"]
   ```

2. **Enable Phase 3 on Spokes** (consumes all_spoke_cidrs for firewall rules):
   ```bash
   cd spoke
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=true"
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=true"
   ```

---
>**Important Deployment Order**: 
> 1. Always deploy Phase 1 first (`deploy_phase2 = false`, `deploy_phase3 = false`)
> 2. Then deploy Phase 2 (`deploy_phase2 = true`, `deploy_phase3 = false`)  
> 3. Then deploy Phase 3 on hub first (`deploy_phase2 = true`, `deploy_phase3 = true`) to generate `all_spoke_cidrs`
> 4. Finally deploy Phase 3 on spokes (`deploy_phase2 = true`, `deploy_phase3 = true`) to consume the output
>
> Spoke deployments depend on the hub's Phase 1 outputs, and hub Phase 2 deployment depends on spoke outputs. Phase 3 requires Phase 2 to be complete and the hub must generate outputs before spokes can consume them.
---

## Critical Dependencies

### Hub Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Provides outputs for spoke consumption (`ncc_subnet_cidr`, `ncc_asn`, `ncc_vpn_gateway_id`)
- **Phase 2**: Requires spoke outputs (`spoke_subnet_cidr`, `spoke_asn`, `spoke_vpn_gateway_id`) from all spoke state files
- **Phase 3**: Provides `all_spoke_cidrs` output for spoke-to-spoke communication (consumed by spokes)

### Spoke Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Requires hub outputs (`ncc_subnet_cidr`, `ncc_asn`, `ncc_vpn_gateway_id`)
- **Phase 2**: Establishes VPN connectivity to hub
- **Phase 3**: Requires hub's `all_spoke_cidrs` output for spoke-to-spoke communication

## Credential Management Best Practices

1. **Secure Storage**: Store service account keys in a secure location outside version control
2. **Least Privilege**: Assign only necessary permissions to each service account
3. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate service account keys
4. **Environment Separation**: Use different service accounts for different environments

## Dependencies

* **Terraform:** Version `>= 1.0.0` 
  * `hashicorp/google` provider, version `~> 6.0` (for managing GCP resources)
  * `hashicorp/random` provider (Hub only), version `~> 3.0` (for generating random IDs)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Required for interacting with GCP APIs and managing credentials.  

### GCP Projects:

- A dedicated GCP project for the hub (`ncc_project_id`).  
- Separate GCP projects for each spoke (`spoke_project_id`).  

### Service Accounts:

- **Hub service account** with appropriate roles in hub and spoke projects
- **Spoke service accounts** with appropriate roles in spoke and hub projects

### GCS Buckets:

- Hub Terraform state bucket (`walid-hub-backend`)  
- Spoke Terraform state buckets (`walid-spoke-a-backend`, `walid-spoke-b-backend`)  
- Shared secrets bucket (`walid-secrets-backend`)  

### Hub-Spoke Dependencies:

- **Spoke Phase 1** requires hub outputs (`ncc_subnet_cidr`, `ncc_asn`, `ncc_vpn_gateway_id`) from hub Phase 1.  
- **Hub Phase 2** requires spoke outputs (`spoke_subnet_cidr`, `spoke_asn`, `spoke_vpn_gateway_id`) from spoke Phase 1.  
- **Spoke Phase 2** requires hub outputs from hub Phase 1.  
- **Spoke Phase 3** requires hub outputs (`all_spoke_cidrs`) from hub Phase 3.

## Destruction Workflow

To safely delete the infrastructure:

1. **Phase 3 Destruction**: Set `deploy_phase3 = false` on all spokes
   ```bash
   cd spoke
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=true" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   ```

2. **Phase 2 Destruction**: Set `deploy_phase2 = false` on hub and spokes **SIMULTANEOUSLY**
   ```bash
   # Hub and ALL spokes must run this at the same time
   cd hub
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   cd ../spoke
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform apply -var="deploy_phase2=false" -var="deploy_phase3=false"
   ```

3. **Phase 1 Destruction**: Destroy all resources
   ```bash
   cd hub
   terraform destroy
   
   cd ../spoke
   terraform destroy
   
   cd ../spoke2
   terraform destroy
   ```

### **Important Destruction Notice**

Phase 2 and Phase 3 resources have implicit cross-project dependencies through Terraform remote state references. The hub's Phase 2 deployment depends on spoke state data, and spokes' Phase 2/3 deployments depend on hub state data. 

**For Destruction:**
- **Phase 3 must be destroyed before Phase 2** across all spokes
- **Phase 2 must be destroyed simultaneously** across hub and all spokes
- **Phase 1 can be destroyed independently** after Phase 2 is fully removed

If you destroy Phase 1 resources before Phase 2, Terraform will be unable to properly destroy Phase 2 resources due to missing state dependencies, requiring you to:
1. Redeploy Phase 1 resources
2. Destroy Phase 2 resources 
3. Finally destroy Phase 1 resources

**Never delete state files before running `terraform destroy`**
